# üî¥ Err 1.

### Img not showing

#### When we click on the image inside the <u>collection</u> page, we are redirected into another page, this page is the the:

- [nftId].js

#### Normally after we set up the component containing the _Img_ in this case <u>components/nft/NFTImage.js</u>, that will be passed through PROPS to the <u>pages/nfts/[nftId].js </u> this image should show up, but it didnt.

# üêñ

#### The first mistake I noticed

- I confused the **id** coming from the **thirdweb** (where i store the market and the nfts)

#### The error

```javascript
Unhandled Runtime Error
Error: cannot estimate gas; transaction may fail or may require manual gas limit [ See: https://links.ethers.org/v5-errors-UNPREDICTABLE_GAS_LIMIT ] (error={"code":-32000,"message":"execution reverted"}, method="call", transaction={"from":"0x557C9888F57A1793FCB2d3ddCEa2bdAb9C301f81","to":"0xCdA1334a27C272c7cFF02bc2CC1563b60e540402","data":"0x75794a3c","accessList":null}, code=UNPREDICTABLE_GAS_LIMIT, version=providers/5.6.0)
```

<br>

#### üåû The reason:

- I confused the key of the **sdk.getNFTModule( )** inside the **[nftid].js**, i added the market key to both instead of having a different key for each like you see in the gif

<br>

```javascript
//
//                  BEFORE
//
return sdk.getNFTModule('0xCdA1334a27C272c7cFF02bc2CC1563b60e540402')
//
//
//                  AFTER
return sdk.getNFTModule('0xB4D9B62983AD4027533905D1DbFcEE732Bc0CEC7')
```

# üî¥ Err 2.

<br>

- Collection page

### After I corrected this issue I noticed that the banner and the image avatar of the user (the one in the center top of the page) of the collection page, wasn't showing...

<br>

- I thought that i might did something wrong with the code, so i tried to find an error in the **type** etc..but everything was okay, eventually i ended up deleting the 2 last component i added to see if the **image issue** persisted, but nothing.

<br>

#### üåà Some how I noticed

- That the server wasn't running in **localhost 3000** and that it was running in **3001** now, because apparently the 3000 was being using somewhere else, in the beginning i didnt think it will be an issue...

#### then I thought, what if the images dont show because of the server running in another port?

<br>

- So I **closed** Visual studio instead of **killing all the servers**, then i open it again and started the server again to see if it would run in **PORT 3000** like before when i started using the images , and **BINGO** , the banner and the avatar are visible again.

<br>

#### I came up with this, because I had a similar issue when working with images coming from MONGODB (since they are stored in an specific port and dont show if you run your server in a different port)
