#### Blockchain development

- THere are many different Blockchain, and in theory **nft's** could be deployed to any of them, however what we have seen so far with **nft's**, is that they are mostly deployed on the **ethereum blockchain**, and besides this, a lot of blockchain are based on the ethereum technology, that is what developers call: **evm** based blockchains.

<br>

- We have many examples of **evm blockchains**, like bannon smart chain, polygon etc, thats why you should focus learning the **Ethereum blockchain**.

<br>

#### In blockchain development there is an important distiction to make, on the one hand there is something developers call: ✋ <u>Blockchain core dev</u> and on the other hand you have what we call:✋ <u>Blockchain application development</u>

<br>

> **Blockchain Core development** is about building the blockchain itself, these are the developers who created the software of **bitcoin** or **ethereum** for example, this is quite complex and only a small **elite** of developers knows how to do it. but that is okay because for NFT's we dont need to do thi, as we build applications on top of the blockchain.

<br>
<br>

> **Blockchain application development** even if you will not develop blockchain code technologies, you will need to have an understanding of the **basics of how blockchain work** and specially ethereum, you will need to learn a few things like the **Proof of work algorithm or POW algorithm**, what is the data structure of the ethereum blockchain, what are public and private keys, how addresses are generated, and the 2 kind of addresses that exist on ethereum, how a wallet work, so that's an external software that manages the private key of each user, what is a **transaction** and how you can change the data inside the ethereum and what is a **SMART CONTRACT**.

<br>

##### Once you know this, your next step is focus on smart PROGRAMMING
