# Collections

#### Now we need to get back to the collections, if you remember we already started it a bit [Here](https://github.com/nadiamariduena/opensea-marketplace/tree/4-header-tailwing-routing), so now we need to make it work:

- SO this is what we have in collections

```javascript
import React from 'react'
import { useRouter } from 'next/router'
import Link from 'next/link'

const collection = () => {
  const router = useRouter()
  //
  console.log(router.query)
  console.log(router.query.collectionId)
  return (
    <Link href="/">
      <h2>{router.query.collectionId}</h2>
    </Link>
  )
}

export default collection
```

<br>

### Start by adding the style

```javascript
const style = {
  bannerImageContainer: `h-[20vh] w-screen overflow-hidden flex justify-center items-center`,
  // h-20	height: 5rem; /* 80px */
  //w-screen	width: 100vw;
  //
  bannerImage: `w-full object-cover`,
  // w-full	width: 100%;  object-cover https://tailwindcss.com/docs/object-fit
  //
  infoContainer: `w-screen px-4`,
  // w-screen	width: 100vw;
  //
  //
  midRow: `w-full flex justify-center text-white`,
  endRow: `w-full flex justify-end text-white`,
  profileImg: `w-40 h-40 object-cover rounded-full border-2 border-[#202225] mt-[-4rem]`,
  //
  //
  socialIconsContainer: `flex text-3xl mb-[-2rem]`,
  //mb = margin-bottom https://shuffle.dev/tailwind/classes/margins/mb-auto
  //
  socialIconsWrapper: `w-44`,
  socialIconsContent: `flex container justify-between text-[1.4rem] border-2 rounded-lg px-2`,
  socialIcon: `my-2`,
  divider: `border-r-2`,
  title: `text-5xl font-bold mb-4`,
  createdBy: `text-lg mb-4`,
  statsContainer: `w-[44vw] flex justify-between py-4 border border-[#151b22] rounded-xl mb-4`,
  collectionStat: `w-1/4`,
  statValue: `text-3xl font-bold w-full flex items-center justify-center`,
  ethLogo: `h-6 mr-2`,
  statName: `text-lg w-full text-center mt-1`,
  description: `text-[#8a939b] text-xl w-max-1/4 flex-wrap mt-4`,
}
```

<br>
<br>

#### Now Add the following:

- Here we will need to add the **provider coming from the web3** , than we will need to add the **collectionId**

<br>

```javascript
import React, { useEffect, useState, useMemo } from 'react'
import { useRouter } from 'next/router'
import Link from 'next/link'


//
import { useWeb3 } from '@3rdweb/hooks' ‚úã
import { client } from '../../lib/sanityClient'  ‚úã
//
/*



*/
const collection = () => {
  const router = useRouter()

  //
  const { provider } = useWeb3() ‚úã
  const { collectionId } = router.query ‚úã
  //
```

<br>

#### Set up an <u>states</u> for collections, nft's & listings coming from the collections we created in the [thirdweb](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard)

- the state is going to give us the possibility to have access to all I mentioned above

```javascript
const [collection, setCollection] = useState({})
const [nfts, setNfts] = useState([])
const [listings, setListings] = useState([])
```

<br>

- the state is going to get **access to all of the below**

<br>

[<img src="./z_img-read/states-to-get-access-thecollection.gif"/>]()

<br>
<br>

# üåà [INFURA ](https://infura.io/)

- "Our suite of high availability **APIs** and Developer Tools provide quick, reliable access to the Ethereum and **IPFS networks** so you can focus on building and scaling next generation software."

<br>

### We are going to need to open an account with INFURA

> ##### "Another service that you will use is INFURA which is an API that runs ethereum clients for you."

##### ‚ö†Ô∏è its not easy to run ethereum client, so infura is very useful when you want to send a transaction to mainnet

<br>

#### Once you have your [INFURA ](https://infura.io/) account, open an [ALCHEMY](https://www.alchemy.com/) account

<br>

#### How does Alchemy work?

> It replaces the **nodes** that businesses use to read and write blockchains with a faster, more scalable decentralized architecture. **It also provides tools for analytics, monitoring, alerting, logging and debugging for cryptocurrency-connected software**

<br>

> ‚ÄúRight now people are trying to build skyscrapers with picks and shovels. We need to give them construction equipment,‚Äù Alchemy co-founder and CEO Nikil Viswanathan tells me. ‚ÄúNone of this exists for blockchain.‚Äù

<br>

- So this is how they look like, but its not over yet

[<img src="./z_img-read/infura-alchemy.gif"/>]()

<br>
<br>

#### Complete the account with [ALCHEMY](https://www.alchemy.com/)

[<img src="./z_img-read/alchemy-completing-account.gif"/>]()

<br>

#### While in Alchemy, create a <u>new app</u>

- Grab the **http key** (in the img i took the other one, but you have to take the http one)

<br>

- üî¥ I will be deleting this at the end of the project, so its useless for you to copy it

```javascript
// HTTP KEY:   https://eth-rinkeby.alchemyapi.io/v2/oneD5PzlO3p18PfmfbguZhfsDWCUvhI2
```
